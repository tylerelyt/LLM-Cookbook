# Lesson 1: Manual Function Call Implementation

This lesson demonstrates how to manually implement the Function Call mechanism, showcasing LLM's ability to autonomously decompose tasks and invoke appropriate tools through the self-ask methodology.

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### Self-Ask Interaction Pattern
```
User Request → LLM Analysis → Function Selection → Function Execution → Result Feedback → Continue Analysis → ...
```

### Key Components
- **Function Registry**: Descriptions and parameters of available functions
- **LLM Reasoning Engine**: Analyzes tasks and decides which functions to call
- **Function Executor**: Actually executes Python functions
- **Result Feedback**: Returns execution results to LLM for continued analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
python function_call_workshop.py
```

## 📊 Workshop Scenario

The workshop demonstrates Function Call through a practical data evaluation task:

1. **Data Generation**: Generate random test data
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate comprehensive statistics 
3. **Intelligent Decision**: LLM evaluates data against specific criteria
4. **Concrete Output**: Clear pass/fail judgment with reasoning

## 💡 Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamental mechanism of Function Call
- Learn how to design function descriptions for LLM comprehension
- Master the implementation of self-ask loops
- Experience LLM-driven autonomous task decomposition
- Observe intelligent tool selection and combination

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

- **Format-Driven**: Strict adherence to `Follow up → Intermediate answer → Final answer` pattern
- **Task Decomposition**: LLM autonomously breaks complex requests into steps
- **Smart Parameter Inference**: Automatic parameter selection based on user requirements
- **Data Flow Management**: Seamless data passing between functions
- **Concrete Results**: Clear, actionable outputs rather than abstract analysis

## 📚 Educational Value

This manual implementation reveals the "black box" of Function Call, showing students:
- How LLM receives complete input at each step
- Why function registration is crucial
- How self-ask format ensures reliable parsing
- What makes LLM choose specific tools and parameters

Perfect foundation for understanding advanced frameworks like AutoGen in subsequent lessons.
